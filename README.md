Project Title:
Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD

Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a software application. It is defined using a Jenkinsfile, which specifies the various stages of the pipeline and the actions to be performed in each stage.

Key Components

Jenkins: An open-source automation server used to implement the CI/CD pipeline.
Jenkinsfile: A script that defines the pipeline stages and steps.
Source Code Repository: A version control system (e.g., Git) where the source code and Jenkinsfile are stored.

Pipeline Stages

Build: Compiles the source code and prepares it for testing.
Test: Runs automated tests to ensure the code quality and functionality.
Deploy: Deploys the application to a specified environment (e.g., staging or production).
Prerequisites
Jenkins installed and running.
Access to a source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
Basic knowledge of Jenkins and pipeline concepts.
Steps to Implement the Pipeline
Install Jenkins: Follow the instructions on the Jenkins website to install Jenkins.
Create a Jenkins Job:
Open Jenkins in your browser.
Click "New Item" to create a new job.
Choose "Pipeline" and give your job a name.
Click "OK" to create the job.
Create a Jenkinsfile in the jenkins by adding the above code in the configure section.
run the pipeline

You will get the following output your pipeline has successfully executed in jenkins.
